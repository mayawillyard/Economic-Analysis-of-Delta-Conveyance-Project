# Homework 3 Review -----
#Load your survey data frame with the read.csv() function. Create a new data frame called surveys_base with only the species_id, the weight, and the plot_type columns. Have this data frame only be the first 5,000 rows. 
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys_base <- surveys [,c(6,9,13)]
surveys_base <- surveys [,c("species_id", "weight", "plot_type")]
surveys_base <- select [1:5000, c("species_id",  "weight", "plot_type")]

#Convert both species_id and plot_type to factors. Remove all rows where there is an NA in the weight column. 

surveys_base$species_id <- factor(surveys_base$species_id)
str(surveys_base) #whats in here
class(surveys_base$species_id) #what type of data is it



#Explore these variables and try to explain why a factor is different from a character. Why might we want to use factors? Can you think of any examples?

#CHALLENGE: Create a second data frame called challenge_base that only consists of individuals from your surveys_base data frame with weights greater than 150g.















# Data Manipulation Part 1b ----
# Goals: learn about mutate, group_by, and summarize
library(tidyverse)
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
str(surveys)


# Adding a new column
# mutate: adds a new column
surveys <- surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/1000)

# Add other columns


# Filter out the NA's


# Group_by and summarize ----
# A lot of data manipulation requires us to split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results
# group_by and summarize functions are often used together to do this
# group_by works for columns with categorical variables 
# we can calculate mean by certain groups
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) 


# multiple groups
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))


# remove na's


# sort/arrange order a certain way


# Challenge
#What was the weight of the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return a table with three columns: year, weight of the heaviest animal in grams, and weight in kilograms, arranged (arrange()) in descending order, from heaviest to lightest. (This table should have 26 rows, one for each year)


#Try out a new function, count(). Group the data by sex and pipe the grouped data into the count() function. How could you get the same result using group_by() and summarize()? Hint: see ?n.
